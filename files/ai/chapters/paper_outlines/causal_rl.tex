\begin{itemize}
  \item Propose to use RL to search for a DAG with the best scoring
  \item Encoder-decoder takes observable data and generates a graph adjacency matrix
  \item Reward = predefined score function + two penalty terms to enforce acyclicity
  \item GES checks acyclicity one edge at a time
  \item Problem is to use observed data $X$ to infer the underlying causal DAG $\mcal{G}$
  \item Modified BIC for score function, used same acyclicity constraint as in NOTEARS
  \item Overall reward function is $-[\mcal{C}(\mcal{G}) + \lambda_{1} I(\mcal{G} \notin \text{DAGs} + \lambda_{2}h(A)]$
  \item Used actor-critic algorithm
\end{itemize}
